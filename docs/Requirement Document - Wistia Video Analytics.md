### **Project Title: End-to-End Data Engineering Project – Wistia Video Analytics**

---

### **🧠 Business Objective**

The marketing team uses **Wistia** to track video engagement across **Facebook** and **YouTube**. We aim to:

* Collect **media-level** and **visitor-level** analytics from Wistia’s **Stats API**  
* Build an automated data pipeline to ingest and analyze performance  
* Use these insights to improve marketing strategies

This project simulates a **real-world data engineering assignment** with full responsibility placed on the student team to **design, implement, and operate** the system.

---

### **🔍 Project Scope**

**You will be responsible for:**

* Designing the entire system architecture: ingestion, storage, processing, and reporting  
* Authenticating and ingesting data from the Wistia Stats API (both media and visitor level)  
* Handling **pagination** and **incremental data pulls**  
* Running the pipeline in **production mode for 7 days**  
* Implementing **CI/CD** using GitHub.  
* Documenting decisions, assumptions, and tradeoffs

---

### **🛠️ Technical Constraints & Freedom**

* You **must design the architecture yourself** and present it to **SME for approval**  
* ***DO NOT USE DBT FOR TRANSFORMATION.***  
* ***DO NOT USE ANYTHING APART FROM AWS/Azure.***  
* You **must use GitHub** for version control and CI/CD  
* You **must use Python** for API ingestion and **PySpark** for data transformation.  
* The pipeline should run for **7 days**.

### **🐍 Example Python Snippet to Connect to Wistia**

```python
import requests

# Wistia API Configuration
API_TOKEN = "0323ade64e13f79821bdc0f2a9410d9ec3873aa9df01f8a4a54d4e0f3dd2e6b4"
MEDIA_ID = "v08dlrgr7v"  # The given media ID

# Wistia Stats API Endpoint
url = f"https://api.wistia.com/v1/stats/medias/{MEDIA_ID}.json"

# API Headers
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_TOKEN}"
}

# Make API Request
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# Handle Response
if response.status_code == 200:
    stats = response.json()
    print("✅ Video Stats Retrieved Successfully:\n")
    print(stats)
elif response.status_code == 401:
    print("❌ Unauthorized: Check your API token permissions.")
elif response.status_code == 404:
    print("❌ Error: Media not found. Check if the media ID is correct.")
else:
    print(f"⚠️ Error: Received status code {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
```

### 📊 Data Model (Simplified)

#### `dim_media`
- media_id
- title
- url
- channel (Facebook, YouTube)
- created_at

#### `dim_visitor`
- visitor_id
- ip_address
- country

#### `fact_media_engagement`
- media_id
- visitor_id
- date
- play_count
- play_rate
- total_watch_time
- watched_percent
